## Video Tutorials

### Neural Network Concepts

These videos are about the core concepts behind neural networks and do not use ml5.js or other ML libraries.

### ml5.js Neural Network

ðŸš¨ _These ml5.js tutorials use an older version of ml5.js, while the concepts and ideas are still relevant the syntax has changed. We will be covering how to to train a neural network using pose detection data in class! The [ml5.js FAQ](https://docs.ml5js.org/#/welcome/faq?id=what-happened-to-older-ml5js-releases) includes additional information._ ðŸš¨

## Assignment  

As a class, we are working towards **March 7th**, where everyone will share a project that applies concepts from the first half of the semester (_pre-trained models with ml5.js, TensorFlow.js, transformers.js_). While training your own model is not required for this project, this week's assignment asks you to imagine an application that would.  

1. Watch [Machine Learning for Human Creative Practice](https://vimeo.com/287094397) by Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink (Eyeo 2018). Reflect on the question: _How can machine learning support and expand creative practices?_  

2. Read [A Brief History of Neural Nets and Deep Learning](https://www.skynettoday.com/overviews/neural-net-history) by Andrey Kurenkov.  

3. Write a short blog post describing a creative application that requires training a custom model. Address the following:  

   - **What is the input?**  
     What data will your model take in? Consider sources such as sensors, body/face/hand keypoints, images, sound, or text. 
     
   - **What is the output?**  
     What will your model predict or generate? Are you classifying labels, predicting continuous values, or something else?  

   - **What kind of learning task is it?**  
     Is this a _classification_ or _regression_ problem? It's okay if you're unsure!  

   - **What challenges do you anticipate?**  
     These could be technical, ethical, or creative obstacles related to data collection, bias, implementation, or user interaction.

4. If you're feeling inspired, start prototyping your idea! You could create a p5.js sketch that collects sample data or explore how a user might interact with your system before training the model.

Document your idea and share it on the [Assignment 4 Wiki](https://github.com/shiffman/ML-for-Creative-Coding/wiki/Assignment-4).
