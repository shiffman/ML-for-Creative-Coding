## Machine Learning Sketch

**Due Thursday March 7**: [Documentation Page](https://github.com/shiffman/ML-for-Creative-Coding/wiki/ML-Sketch).

Now is the time to take the concepts from the first six weeks and apply them to a project idea. This "mid-semester exercise" can be anything that builds off of or is inspired by the material. It does not need to be a "fully realized thing"â€”it can be a visual experiment in progress or a piece of a larger project you are building for another context (thesis, another class, etc.). It can be a continuation of one of your previous exercises that further develops the concepts there, perhaps inspired by feedback you received or any lingering ideas you want to explore.

You should also feel free to think non-traditionally. Your project does not need to be a p5.js sketch and is not specifically required to use web-based ML such as ml5.js, transformers.js, or TensorFlow.js. Think about how machine learning models and concepts can be applied in unexpected ways.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Create a movement-controlled game using hand, body, or face keypoints. Think about how different gestures might influence gameplay or character actions.
- Design a musical instrument that responds to hand, body, or face keypoints, allowing gestures to control sound parameters such as pitch, volume, or effects. Explore creating melodies or soundscapes.
- Build an augmented mirror or photo booth by overlaying p5.js elements on real-time video. Use segmentation or keypoint data to add visuals that respond to movements.
- Make an interactive painting tool controlled by hand, body, or face keypoints. Experiment with effects like trailing particles or dynamic brushes that change shape and color based on gestures.
- Chain models by using the output of one model as input to another with `ml5.neuralNetwork()`. For example, capture body or hand poses to create a custom classifier that drives an interaction. How could regression be applied to modify continuous elements like color gradients or speed?
- Use transfer learning with Teachable Machine to train a custom image classifier on objects from your surroundings. Experiment with using these classifications to trigger interactions, visuals, or sounds in your sketch.

### Documentation and Presentation

Document your project in a blog post and come prepared to share your work for ~5 minutes. You are not required to have a slide deck, but you might find slides useful to help you plan and structure your demo. [Add a link to your documentation to the wiki page](https://github.com/shiffman/ML-for-Creative-Coding/wiki/ML-Sketch).

Consider including:

- **Title**
- **Sketch link**
- **One-sentence description**
- **Summary (250-500 words)**
- **Visual documentation** such as a recorded screen capture, video, or GIFs.
- **Inspiration:** How did you become interested in this idea? Include quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social issues, etc.
- **Process:** How did you make this? What did you struggle with? What was easy? What was difficult?
- **Code references:** What examples, tutorials, and references did you use to create the project? (You must cite the source of any code you use in code comments. Please note the following additional expectations and guidelines at the bottom of this page.)
- **Next steps:** If you had more time to work on this, what would you do next?
